I am currently a *PhD student* in the department of Mathematics of LSE; my interests are mainly in Graph Theory, Game Theory, and Reinforcement Learning, but I'm always happy to explore new areas.

Alongside my university projects, I currently am:

-   Collaborating with the [UGUALI!](https://firmereferendum.giustizia.it/referendum/open/dettaglio-open/3600000) referendum, aiming to introduce equality between marriage and civil unions in Italy (de-facto introducing same-sex marriage in Italy).
-   Leading a cross-field project for a EU proposal of new regulations regarding nutritional information on food packaging.
-   Contributing to a project for Carbon Credit Assessment, in collaboration with the Paraguayan government.
-   Writing a cooking book with all my family's traditional recipes.
