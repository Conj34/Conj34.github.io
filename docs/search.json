    "text": "Contact\n\n\n\n\nName: Domenico Mergoni\nEmail: d.mergoni -at- lse.ac.uk\nWork: London School of Economics\n\n\n\nEvery morning, I receive an email from Arxiv. Arxiv is an online platform used in the scientific community to share new results, quite similar to a Facebook, LinkedIn or Instagram for nerds scientists. These emails are super cool: they contain all the results published on the platform about your area(s) of interest in the last 24hrs, and a link to the relevant papers. This is quite useful and it allows you to keep track of the recent results without too much effort.\nHowever, there is a (small) problem: every new article has a page and a pdf. The page only contains the abstract, the pdf contains the whole article. Here’s the pickle: in the email is only contained the link to the page of the article, and not to the pdf.\nSo every morning I have to click the link to the papers I’m interested in, and THEN click again in the page to find the pdf. TWO CLICKS TO READ AN ARTICLE? That’s too much. From today, no more!\n\ndef get_pdf_url(line: \"line of email with url\") -&gt; \"url of the pdf\":\n    ### We assume a lot about the structure of the line of the link.\n    if \"/abs/\" not in line:\n        return \"https://www.google.com\"\n    sta = line.split(\"/abs/\")[1]\n    end = sta.find(\" , \")\n    return \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/\"+sta[:end]+\".pdf\"\n\nimport webbrowser\ntoday = open(\"./today.txt\",\"r\")\nfor line in today.readlines():\n    print(line)\n    if \"https\" in line:\n        url = get_pdf_url(line)\n        print(url)\n        webbrowser.open(url)\nTo use this code is enough to:\n\nSave the code above in a file with filename ending in .py,\nEvery morning, copy your email in a file with name “today.txt” in the same folder as the Python file,\nExecute the Python file.\n\nMake sure you have installed webbrowser with pip install webbrowser in the terminal."
