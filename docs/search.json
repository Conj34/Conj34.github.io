    "text": "Contact\n\n\n\n\nName: Domenico Mergoni\nEmail: d.mergoni -at- lse.ac.uk\nWork: London School of Economics\n\n\n\nI appreciate a lot this project by Shane Sherman, which is an attempt to create a list of “best books” based on the compound information found on various highly accredited lists (there are obvious critiques, about western, white, male biases etc., but I don’t think this is relevant in the context of this page). What I am going to do in this page is to have an idea of which authors have more works considered the best.\nOne can proceed as follows: download the .csv file from the website of the aforementioned project. Modify the .csv file such that the first row reads:\n\n\n\nPosition\nTitle\nAuthor\nYear\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same folder where you saved the .csv file, you can create a .py file with the following code.\n1import pandas as pd\n\n2df = pd.read_csv(\"tgb_1.csv\")\nmylist = df[\"Author\"]\n\n3splittings = [100, 500, 1000, len(mylist)]\nN = len(splittings)\nPartial_lists = [mylist[:i] for i in splittings]\n\n4Counts = [pd.Series(Partial_lists[j]).value_counts() for j in range(N)]\n\n5Lower = [0 for i in range(N)]\nAt_least = 10\nfor i in range(N):\n    for j in range(30, -1, -1):\n        if len(Counts[i][Counts[i]&gt;=j])&gt;=At_least:\n            Lower[i]=j\n            break\nFinal_list_authors = [Counts[i][Counts[i]&gt;=Lower[i]] for i in range(N)]\n\n6for i in range(N):\n    print(\"These are the authors that have the most (at least \"+str(Lower[i])+\") publications\\namongst the first \"+str(splittings[i])+\"\"\" many \"Best books\" \"\"\")\n    print(Final_list_authors[i].to_string()+\"\\n\")\n\n1\n\nImport the pandas library. Useful for statistics.\n\n2\n\nRead the .csv file and save in a pandas array the column with header Author (this is why a modification of the file was necessary).\n\n3\n\nWe create 4 lists. The first analyses the first 100 books, the second the first 500 books and so on. Partial_lists is a list that contains in entry i a pandas list with the authors of the first splittings[i]-many books.\n\n4\n\nWe count the occurrencies in each of the partial lists.\n\n5\n\nWe select in each list Partial_lists[i] the first authors. These are the authors that have at least Lower[i] many books in that list. Lower[i] is choosen in such a way that the authors as as few as possible above At_least. So for example in the first list, if we set Lower[0]=3 we would only obtain 5 authors, this is why we set Lower[0]=2.\n\n6\n\nPrinting.\n\n\nThe output is:\nThese are the authors that have the most (at least 2) publications\namongst the first 100 many \"Best books\" \nErnest Hemingway      4\nFranz Kafka           4\nFyodor Dostoyevsky    4\nWilliam Faulkner      3\nVirginia Woolf        3\nVladimir Nabokov      2\nSophocles             2\nJames Joyce           2\nStendhal              2\nCharles Dickens       2\nJane Austen           2\nGeorge Orwell         2\nGustave Flaubert      2\nHomer                 2\nLeo Tolstoy           2\n\nThese are the authors that have the most (at least 4) publications\namongst the first 500 many \"Best books\" \nSophocles              7\nCharles Dickens        7\nErnest Hemingway       6\nWilliam Shakespeare    6\nC.

The only women appearing are Virginia Woold, Jane Austen, Edith Wharton, J.K. Rowling, Iris Murdoch, Margaret Atwood and Alice Munro; with Woolf and Austen being the only ones in the first list.\nChatGPT is a mess, but it seems that the only author not born in Europe (including Russia) or US/Canada is Coetzee (South Africa).

Arxiv is an online platform used in the scientific community to share new results, quite similar to a Facebook, LinkedIn or Instagram for nerds scientists. These emails are super cool: they contain all the results published on the platform about your area(s) of interest in the last 24hrs, and a link to the relevant papers. This is quite useful and it allows you to keep track of the recent results without too much effort.\nHowever, there is a (small) problem: every new article has a page and a pdf. The page only contains the abstract, the pdf contains the whole article. Here’s the pickle: in the email is only contained the link to the page of the article, and not to the pdf.\nSo every morning I have to click the link to the papers I’m interested in, and THEN click again in the page to find the pdf. TWO CLICKS TO READ AN ARTICLE? That’s too much. From today, no more!\n\ndef get_pdf_url(line: \"line of email with url\") -&gt; \"url of the pdf\":\n    ### We assume a lot about the structure of the line of the link.\n    if \"/abs/\" not in line:\n        return \"https://www.google.com\"\n    sta = line.split(\"/abs/\")[1]\n    end = sta.find(\" , \")\n    return \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/\"+sta[:end]+\".pdf\"\n\nimport webbrowser\ntoday = open(\"./today.txt\",\"r\")\nfor line in today.readlines():\n    if \"https\" in line:\n        url = get_pdf_url(line)\n        webbrowser.open(url)\nTo use this code is enough to:\n\nSave the code above in a file with filename ending in .py,\nEvery morning, copy your email in a file with name “today.txt” in the same folder as the Python file,\nExecute the Python file.\n\nMake sure you have installed webbrowser with pip install webbrowser in the terminal.",

The first part of the course covers elementary and important statistical methods including nearest neighbours, linear regression, logistic regression, regularisation, cross-validation, and variable selection. The second part of the course deals with more advanced machine learning methods including regression and classification trees, random forests, bagging, boosting, deep neural networks, k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. The course will also introduce causal inference motivated by analogy between double machine learning and two-stage least squares. All the topics will be delivered using illustrative real data examples. Students will also gain hands-on experience using R or Python (programming languages and software environments for data analysis, computing and visualisation).\n\nMaterial and solutions\n\nI did not write the following material, which was prepared by Joshua Loftus.
