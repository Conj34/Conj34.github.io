I do not have anymore any material I created during the teaching of this course. I can quote however the course overview. Because the material is quite basic, I don't think it's worth the effort to go and try to find more details about what was done and taught.

<h3>Course content <small><small><small>(Official)</small></small></small></h3>
The course provides a rigorous, but accessible, treatment of real analysis and analysis on metric spaces and will be delivered by formal lectures supported by interactive classes.

- Basics: proof, logic, sets and functions,
- Real numbers and sequences,
- Functions, limits and continuity,
- Infinite series,
- Metric and normed spaces,
- Convergence, completeness and compactness,
- Continuity in metric spaces,
- The derivative,
- Convexity,
- Fixed point theorems.
