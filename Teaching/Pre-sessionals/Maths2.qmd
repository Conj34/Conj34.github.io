<h2>Introduction to Derivatives</h2>

-   **Introduction to Derivatives**
    -   **What is a Derivative?**
        -   Definition of a derivative as the instantaneous rate of change.
        -   Notation: $f'(x)$, $\frac{dy}{dx}$.
        -   Example: Calculate the derivative of $f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 5$.
        -   Exercise: Find the derivative of given functions.
    -   **The Concept of Instantaneous Rate of Change**
        -   Understanding how derivatives relate to slopes of tangent lines.
        -   Example: Interpret the derivative of a position function as velocity.
        -   Exercise: Interpret derivatives in real-world contexts.
    -   **Notation and Interpretation**
        -   Discuss the meaning of $f'(x)$ and $\frac{dy}{dx}$ in context.
        -   Emphasize the connection between slope and rate of change.
        -   Exercise: Match graphs of functions with their derivatives.
-   **Derivatives of Linear and Quadratic Functions**
    -   **Finding the Derivative of Linear Functions**
        -   Deriving the derivative of linear functions.
        -   Example: Find the derivative of $L(x) = 2x + 4$.
        -   Exercise: Differentiate linear functions with different coefficients.
    -   **Finding the Derivative of Quadratic Functions**
        -   Differentiating quadratic functions using the power rule.
        -   Example: Differentiate $q(x) = -3x^2 + 5x - 1$.
        -   Exercise: Derive quadratic functions with various coefficients.
    -   **Tangent Lines and Rates of Change**
        -   Connecting derivatives to slopes of tangent lines.
        -   Calculating slopes of tangent lines at specific points.
        -   Example: Find the equation of the tangent line to $f(x) = x^2$ at $x = 2$.
-   **Basic Rules of Differentiation**
    -   **Power Rule for Differentiation**
        -   Statement and derivation of the power rule.
        -   Example: Differentiate $g(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x$ using the power rule.
        -   Exercise: Apply the power rule to various functions.
    -   **Constant Rule and Sum Rule**
        -   Using the constant rule and sum rule to differentiate functions.
        -   Example: Find the derivative of $h(x) = 3 + 2x^2 - 5x$.
        -   Exercise: Differentiate expressions involving constants and sums.
    -   **Differentiating Polynomial Functions**
        -   Applying differentiation rules to polynomial functions.
        -   Example: Differentiate $p(x) = 6x^4 + 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 5$.
        -   Exercise: Differentiate given polynomial functions.
-   **Applications of Derivatives**
    -   **Finding Maxima and Minima**
        -   Using derivatives to locate critical points.
        -   Identifying maxima, minima, and points of inflection.
        -   Example: Find the critical points of $g(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x$.
    -   **Tangent Lines as Approximations**
        -   Using tangent lines for linear approximations.
        -   Example: Estimate $\sqrt{9.2}$ using the tangent line at $x = 9$ for $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$.
    -   **Simple Optimization Problems**
        -   Applying derivatives to solve basic optimization problems.
        -   Example: Find the dimensions of a rectangle with maximum area given a fixed perimeter.
