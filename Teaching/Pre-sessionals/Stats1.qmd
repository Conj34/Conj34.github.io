<h2>Introduction to Basic Statistics</h2>

-   **Introduction to Statistics**
    -   **What is Statistics and its Importance**
        -   Define statistics as the study of data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
        -   Explain the importance of statistics in decision-making and research.
        -   Example: Discuss how statistics are used in medical research.
    -   **Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics**
        -   Differentiate between descriptive and inferential statistics.
        -   Emphasize the role of each in understanding and drawing conclusions from data.
        -   Exercise: Provide scenarios and determine whether descriptive or inferential statistics would be used.
    -   **Types of Data: Categorical and Numerical**
        -   Explain the distinction between categorical and numerical data.
        -   Provide examples of each type of data.
        -   Exercise: Classify given data sets as categorical or numerical.
-   **Measures of Central Tendency**
    -   **Mean, Median, and Mode**
        -   Define and explain the concepts of mean, median, and mode.
        -   Illustrate how to calculate each measure.
        -   Example: Calculate mean, median, and mode for a set of exam scores.
        -   Exercise: Compute mean, median, and mode for different data sets.
    -   **Calculating and Interpreting Each Measure**
        -   Discuss the interpretation of mean, median, and mode in terms of centrality.
        -   Highlight scenarios where each measure is useful.
        -   Exercise: Analyze the implications of outliers on measures of central tendency.
    -   **Real-World Examples**
        -   Provide real-world examples where mean, median, and mode are applied.
        -   Discuss their relevance in various contexts, such as finance or education.
        -   Exercise: Analyze a dataset from a real-world scenario and calculate central tendency measures.
-   **Measures of Dispersion**
    -   **Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation**
        -   Define and explain the concepts of range, variance, and standard deviation.
        -   Demonstrate how to calculate each measure.
        -   Example: Calculate the range, variance, and standard deviation for a data set.
        -   Exercise: Compute range, variance, and standard deviation for different datasets.
    -   **Interpreting Variability**
        -   Discuss the importance of measures of dispersion in understanding data spread.
        -   Explain how variability affects the interpretation of central tendency measures.
        -   Exercise: Compare and contrast datasets with different measures of dispersion.
    -   **Variance and Standard Deviation for Populations vs. Samples**
        -   Explain the difference between calculating variance and standard deviation for populations and samples.
        -   Discuss when to use the population formula versus the sample formula.
        -   Example: Calculate the population and sample variance and standard deviation for a dataset.
-   **Quantiles and Percentiles**
    -   **Definition of Quantiles and Percentiles**
        -   Define quantiles and percentiles as measures of position in a dataset.
        -   Explain how they divide data into equal parts.
        -   Exercise: Calculate the quartiles and percentiles for a dataset.
    -   **Calculation and Interpretation**
        -   Discuss how to calculate quantiles and percentiles using order statistics.
        -   Interpret the meaning of specific quantiles and percentiles.
        -   Example: Calculate the interquartile range and 75th percentile for a dataset.
        -   Exercise: Calculate and interpret quantiles and percentiles for various datasets.
    -   **Box Plots and Their Use in Visualizing Quantiles**
        -   Explain how box plots represent the five-number summary and outliers.
        -   Discuss the components of a box plot (whiskers, box, median, outliers).
        -   Example: Create a box plot for a dataset and analyze its features.
        -   Exercise: Construct box plots for given datasets and identify characteristics.
-   **Conclusion and Recap**
    -   Summarize the key concepts covered in the lecture.
-   **Q&A Session**
