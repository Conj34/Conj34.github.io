* **Introduction to Systems of Equations** (10 minutes)
  + **What is a System of Equations?** (3 minutes)
      -Definition of a system of equations as a set of equations with common variables.
      -Example: Discuss a system representing the total cost of items purchased.
  + **Methods for Solving Systems** (4 minutes)
      -Briefly explain graphing, substitution, and elimination methods.
      -Highlight when each method is most suitable.
      -Exercise: Identify which method is best for a given system.

  + **Importance and Applications** (3 minutes)
      -Emphasize the significance of systems of equations in solving real-world problems.
      -Mention applications in various fields.
      -Exercise: Brainstorm other scenarios where systems could be applied.

**Graphical Solution** (15 minutes)
  + **Solving Systems Graphically** (7 minutes)
      -Explain the concept of solution points as intersections of graphs.
      -Example: Solve the system $2x + y = 5$ and $3x     -y = 1$ graphically.
      -Exercise: Graph and solve simple systems of equations.

  + **Interpreting Solutions on Graphs** (4 minutes)
      -Discuss the significance of unique solutions, no solutions, and infinite solutions.
      -Interpret the graphical meaning of these cases.
      -Exercise: Analyze different scenarios on graphs.

  + **Advantages and Limitations** (4 minutes)
      -Compare graphical method with other methods.
      -Discuss accuracy and limitations of graphical solutions.

**Substitution and Elimination Methods** (20 minutes)
  + **Solving Systems using Substitution** (10 minutes)
      -Explain the substitution method step by step.
      -Example: Solve the system $3x     -2y = 8$ and $x + y = 3$ using substitution.
      -Exercise: Practice solving systems using the substitution method.

  + **Solving Systems using Elimination** (10 minutes)
      -Explain the elimination (addition) method step by step.
      -Example: Solve the system $2x + 3y = 7$ and $4x     -y = 5$ using elimination.
      -Exercise: Practice solving systems using the elimination method.

**Applications of Systems of Equations** (15 minutes)
  + **Real-World Examples of Systems** (5 minutes)
