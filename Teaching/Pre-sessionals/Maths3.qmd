<h2>Systems of Linear Equations</h2>

-   **Introduction to Systems of Equations**
    -   **What is a System of Equations?**
        -   Definition of a system of equations as a set of equations with common variables.
        -   Example: Discuss a system representing the total cost of items purchased.
    -   **Methods for Solving Systems**
        -   Briefly explain graphing, substitution, and elimination methods.
        -   Highlight when each method is most suitable.
        -   Exercise: Identify which method is best for a given system.
    -   **Importance and Applications**
        -   Emphasize the significance of systems of equations in solving real-world problems.
        -   Mention applications in various fields.
        -   Exercise: Brainstorm other scenarios where systems could be applied.
-   **Graphical Solution**
    -   **Solving Systems Graphically**
        -   Explain the concept of solution points as intersections of graphs.
        -   Example: Solve the system $2x + y = 5$ and $3x -y = 1$ graphically.
        -   Exercise: Graph and solve simple systems of equations.
    -   **Interpreting Solutions on Graphs**
        -   Discuss the significance of unique solutions, no solutions, and infinite solutions.
        -   Interpret the graphical meaning of these cases.
        -   Exercise: Analyze different scenarios on graphs.
    -   **Advantages and Limitations**
        -   Compare graphical method with other methods.
        -   Discuss accuracy and limitations of graphical solutions.
-   **Substitution and Elimination Methods**
    -   **Solving Systems using Substitution**
        -   Explain the substitution method step by step.
        -   Example: Solve the system $3x -2y = 8$ and $x + y = 3$ using substitution.
        -   Exercise: Practice solving systems using the substitution method.
    -   **Solving Systems using Elimination**
        -   Explain the elimination (addition) method step by step.
        -   Example: Solve the system $2x + 3y = 7$ and $4x -y = 5$ using elimination.
        -   Exercise: Practice solving systems using the elimination method.
-   **Applications of Systems of Equations**
    -   **Real-World Examples of Systems**
        -   Discuss examples from fields like economics, chemistry, and engineering.
        -   Example: Discuss a mixture problem involving two solutions.
        -   Exercise: Brainstorm more real-world examples.
    -   **Using Systems to Solve Practical Problems**
        -   Explain how to set up and solve practical problems using systems.
        -   Example: Solve a money-related problem involving different types of coins.
        -   Exercise: Solve practical problems related to mixtures, interest, or other scenarios.
    -   **Reflection on Problem-Solving**
        -   Highlight the problem-solving process and the role of systems.
        -   Encourage students to think critically and apply these methods.
