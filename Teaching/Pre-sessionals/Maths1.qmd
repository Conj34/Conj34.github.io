<h2>Introduction to Functions and Linear Equations</h2>

-   **Introduction to Functions**

    -   **What is a function?**
        -   Definition: A function is a relation between a set of inputs (domain) and a set of possible outputs (range), such that each input is related to exactly one output.
        -   Example: Temperature conversion function.
        -   Exercise: Identify whether given relations are functions or not.
    -   **Domain and Range of a function**
        -   Definition of domain and range.
        -   Example: Find the domain and range of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$.
        -   Exercise: Determine the domain and range of a given function.
    -   **Notation and Terminology**
        -   Notation: $f(x)$ represents the output of function $f$ for input $x$.
        -   Terminology: Input, output, independent variable, dependent variable, etc.
        -   Exercise: Translate word problems into function notation.

-   **Linear Functions**

    -   **Definition of Linear Functions**
        -   A linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line.
        -   Example: $f(x) = 2x + 3$ is a linear function.
        -   Exercise: Determine whether given functions are linear or not.
    -   **Graphing Linear Functions**
        -   Plotting points and connecting with a line.
        -   Example: Graph the function $f(x) = -0.5x + 2$.
        -   Exercise: Graph a set of linear functions.
    -   **Slope and** $y$-Intercept
        -   Definition of slope and $y$-intercept.
        -   Calculation of slope and $y$-intercept from an equation.
        -   Example: Find the slope and $y$-intercept of $f(x) = 3x - 1$.
        -   Exercise: Calculate slope and $y$-intercept of given functions.

-   **Polynomial Functions of Degree 2**

    -   **Definition of Polynomial Functions**
        -   A polynomial function is a function consisting of terms with non-negative integer powers.
        -   Example: $f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 1$ is a polynomial function.
        -   Exercise: Identify polynomial functions among given expressions.
    -   **Quadratic Functions**
        -   Definition and standard form: $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.
        -   Example: Identify coefficients of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $f(x) = 5x^2 - 2x + 7$.
        -   Exercise: Write quadratic functions in standard form.
    -   **Graphing Quadratic Functions**
        -   Plotting quadratic curves.
        -   Finding vertex and axis of symmetry.
        -   Example: Graph $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3$ and find its vertex.
        -   Exercise: Graph given quadratic functions and locate their vertices.

-   **Applications of Functions**

    -   **Real-World Examples of Functions**
        -   Distance-time and temperature-time functions.
        -   Example: Express the height of an object in terms of time.
        -   Exercise: Identify functions in everyday scenarios.
    -   **Modeling with Linear and Quadratic Functions**
        -   Using linear functions for proportional relationships.
        -   Using quadratic functions for parabolic motion.
        -   Example: Model the height of a ball thrown vertically upward.
        -   Exercise: Model a real-world scenario using a linear or quadratic function.
    -   **Simple Problems Involving Functions**
        -   Solving basic problems using functions.
        -   Example: Find the time when a car reaches a certain distance.
        -   Exercise: Solve problems involving linear and quadratic functions.
