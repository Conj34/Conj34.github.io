<h3>Report <small><small><small>(of Maths Lecture 4)</small></small></small></h3>


- **Introduction to Supply and Demand** 
  - **Basic Concepts of Supply and Demand** 
    - Define supply and demand as fundamental economic concepts.
    - Explain how they determine prices and quantities in markets.
    - Example: Discuss the relationship between gas prices and demand during holidays.
  
  - **Equilibrium Point and Market Equilibrium** 
    - Define equilibrium point as the intersection of supply and demand curves.
    - Emphasize the role of equilibrium in establishing market prices.
    - Exercise: Analyze a simple supply and demand graph to find equilibrium.
  
- **Supply and Demand Equations** 
  - **Modeling Supply and Demand using Linear Equations** 
    - Discuss how linear equations can represent supply and demand relationships.
    - Example: Construct a linear demand equation based on given data.
    - Exercise: Write linear supply and demand equations from provided information.
  
  - **Equilibrium Price and Quantity** 
    - Explain how to find equilibrium price and quantity from supply and demand equations.
    - Example: Solve for equilibrium point using a supply and demand equation.
    - Exercise: Calculate equilibrium price and quantity for different scenarios.
  
- **Shifts in Supply and Demand** 
  - **Factors Causing Shifts in Supply and Demand Curves** 
    - Identify factors that can lead to shifts in supply and demand curves.
    - Discuss examples such as changes in consumer preferences or technological advancements.
    - Exercise: Identify possible shifts due to external factors.
  
  - **Effects on Equilibrium Price and Quantity** 
    - Explain how shifts affect equilibrium price and quantity.
    - Discuss scenarios of price increases, decreases, and quantity changes.
    - Example: Analyze the impact of a decrease in production costs on equilibrium.
    - Exercise: Predict the outcomes of shifts in supply and demand curves.
  
- **Applications to Real-World Scenarios** 
  - **Applying Supply and Demand Analysis to Real-World Scenarios** 
    - Present scenarios like price ceilings, shortages, and surpluses.
    - Discuss the implications of government interventions on markets.
    - Exercise: Analyze the effects of a price ceiling on a graph.
  
  - **Understanding Market Dynamics and Changes** 
    - Emphasize the importance of understanding supply and demand dynamics in decision-making.
    - Discuss how businesses and policymakers use these concepts.
    - Example: Explain how supply and demand analysis can help plan for seasonal products.
  
- **Conclusion and Recap** 
    -   Summarize the key concepts covered in the lecture.
    -   Highlight the importance of functions in various fields.
    
- **Q&A Session**
