-   **Histograms and Frequency Distributions**
    -   **Creating Histograms**
        -   Define histograms as graphical representations of data distributions.
        -   Explain the concept of bins and their role in constructing histograms.
        -   Example: Create a histogram for a set of exam scores.
        -   Exercise: Construct a histogram for a given dataset.
    -   **Understanding Frequency Distributions**
        -   Define frequency distributions as tables summarizing data frequency.
        -   Explain how to organize data into intervals and record frequencies.
        -   Example: Create a frequency distribution table for a dataset.

    -   **Constructing Bar Plots for Categorical Data**
        -   Define bar plots as visual representations of categorical data.
        -   Explain how to create vertical and horizontal bar plots.
        -   Example: Construct a bar plot for survey responses.
        -   Exercise: Create bar plots for given categorical data.
    -   **Interpreting Pie Charts**
        -   Define pie charts as circular representations of parts of a whole.
        -   Explain how to calculate angles and percentages for each category.
        -   Example: Interpret a pie chart depicting distribution of expenses.
        -   Exercise: Interpret and analyze pie charts.
    -   **Use Cases and Limitations of Each Plot**
        -   Discuss when to use bar plots and pie charts based on data characteristics.
        -   Highlight limitations and potential misinterpretations of these plots.
        -   Exercise: Determine which plot is more suitable for a given dataset.
-   **Box Plots (Box-and-Whisker Plots)**
    -   **Definition and Components of a Box Plot**
        -   Define box plots as visualizations of the five-number summary.
        -   Explain the components: median, quartiles, whiskers, and outliers.
        -   Example: Describe the features of a box plot.
        -   Exercise: Identify components of box plots from provided data.
    -   **Creating Box Plots for Numerical Data**
        -   Explain how to create a box plot using numerical data.

        -   Exercise: Construct box plots for given numerical datasets.
    -   **Identifying Median, Quartiles, Outliers, and Range**
        -   Demonstrate how to locate median, quartiles, and outliers on a box plot.
        -   Explain how to calculate the interquartile range (IQR).
        -   Exercise: Analyze box plots and calculate IQR for different datasets.
-   **Scatter Plots and Correlation**
    -   **Creating Scatter Plots**
        -   Define scatter plots as representations of relationships between two numerical variables.
        -   Explain how to plot data points and interpret patterns.
        -   Example: Create a scatter plot for height and weight data.
