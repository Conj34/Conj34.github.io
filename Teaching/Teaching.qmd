{{< include /support/_margins_Teaching.qmd >}} These pages contain some of the material I used to aid my teaching during my years at LSE. Some of the material I created myself, some was given by the various lecturers of the courses, some I found online and I propose here again in a selected format.

For a quick overview of my teaching, you can consult the following table.
