## Tip

Internet is a great resource. Use it. Some resources I like:

1.  [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/c/mitocw/featured),
2.  [Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/c/stanford/featured),
3.  [Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/c/harvard).

## Beware, the Crime!

It is illegal to download articles and books from pages like [LibGen](http://libgen.li/), [Sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se/) or from Telegram bots like [\@scihubot](http://t.me/scihubot). Also, DO NOT use VPN to protect your freedom of education ([Opera](https://www.opera.com) offers a free VPN).
