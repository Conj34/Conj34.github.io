The goal of this section is to collect resources and thougths, and to record my learning progresses regarding topics I am not proficient in, mainly Competitive Coding, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning.

These are my main motivations behind this decision.

-   I did not find online any resource tailored to my need,
-   I hope this might help other people to get close to these topics,
-   The best way to learn is to teach.

<i> Caveat: I know Python is NOT the best language for competitive coding, but since my objective for now is not perfection, I will mainly use Python for now. </i>

Please do let me know if you find any mistakes.
